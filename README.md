## Entity Relational Diagram.

In this assigment we need to transform an **Entity Relational Diagram** to **Relational Diagram** with the last work.

Here the **Entity Relational Diagram** :

![ERDiagram](/images/SupermercadoER.drawio.png)

This diagram is different about the last one, I have changed some thing's.

## Relational Model

This is the transformation from **ER** to **Relational Model** :

![RelationalModel](/images/Relational.png)

In [src](/src/) we have the [DDL](/src/SuperDDL.sql) script to generate this in our MariaDB or MYSQL.
